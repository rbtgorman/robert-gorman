## Project Overview

As part of my M.S. in Business Analytics curriculum at Rutgers University, I conducted comprehensive large-scale data analysis on research datasets, demonstrating proficiency in handling enterprise-level data volumes and applying advanced analytical techniques.

### Key Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data processing and analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model implementation
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive development and documentation
- **Statistical Analysis**: Hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, predictive modeling

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline

Developed robust Python-based data processing pipelines capable of handling datasets with 10,000+ records. The pipeline included:

- **Data Extraction**: Automated data ingestion from multiple sources
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data validation
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating derived variables and transforming features for optimal model performance
- **Data Transformation**: Normalization, scaling, and encoding categorical variables

### Machine Learning Models

Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms:

1. **Decision Trees**: Built classification models with optimized hyperparameters
2. **Logistic Regression**: Applied for binary and multiclass classification problems
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Utilized Random Forests and Gradient Boosting for improved accuracy
4. **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and performance metrics

## Results & Impact

- Successfully processed and analyzed large-scale datasets with high computational efficiency
- Achieved strong predictive accuracy through ensemble modeling techniques
- Demonstrated ability to extract actionable insights from complex data structures
